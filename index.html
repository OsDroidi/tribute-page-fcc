            <h1>1975–1997: Early life and career beginnings</h1>
            <p>Sia Kate Isobelle Furler was born on 18 December 1975 in Adelaide, South Australia. Her father, Phil Colson,
                is a musician, and her mother, Loene Furler, is an art lecturer. Sia is the niece of actor-singer Kevin
                Colson. Sia said that as a child she imitated the performing style of Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and
                Sting, whom she cites as early influences. She attended Adelaide High School. In the mid-1990s, Sia started
                a career as a singer in the local acid jazz band Crisp. Sia collaborated with the band and contributed
                vocals to their album Word and the Deal (1995) and EP Delirium (1997). In 1997 Crisp disbanded, and Sia
                released her debut studio album, OnlySee, on Flavoured Records, in Australia, on 23 December. The album sold
                about 1,200 copies. Unlike her later albums, OnlySee was marketed under her full name, "Sia Furler". It was
                produced by Jesse Flavell.</p>

            <h1>1997–2006: Zero 7, Healing Is Difficult and Colour the Small One</h1>
            <p>After Crisp disbanded in 1997, Sia moved to London, where she performed as a background vocalist for British
                band
                Jamiroquai. She also provided lead vocals for English downtempo group Zero 7 on their first three studio
                albums and
                toured with the group. On Zero 7's 2001 album Simple Things, Sia contributed vocals to two tracks including
                the single
                "Destiny", which peaked at No. 30 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2004, she provided vocals for Zero 7 on
                "Somersault" and
                "Speed Dial No. 2" (from the album When It Falls). In 2006, Sia again collaborated with Zero 7 for the
                group's third
                album, The Garden and hence she is regarded as the "unofficial" lead singer of Zero 7.</p>

            <h1>2007–2010: Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born</h1>
            <p>In 2007, Sia released a live album titled Lady Croissant, which included eight live songs from her April 2006
                performance at the Bowery Ballroom in New York and one new studio recording—"Pictures". A year later, she
                left Zero 7 on
                good terms to focus on her solo career and was replaced by Eska Mtungwazi as the band's frontwoman. Sia
                released her
                fourth studio album, Some People Have Real Problems on 8 January 2008. The album peaked at No. 41 in
                Australia and was
                certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association. It charted at No. 26 on the US Billboard
                200, becoming
                Sia's first to chart in the United States. Some People Have Real Problems yielded four singles, including
                "The Girl You
                Lost to Cocaine". It peaked at No. 11 in the Netherlands and No. 12 in Spain; it additionally reached No. 8
                on the US
                Hot Dance Club Songs. Another single from the album was "Soon We'll Be Found".</p>

            <h1>2010–2013: Songwriting career and mainstream recognition</h1>
            <p>Following the success of We Are Born, Sia became uncomfortable with her growing fame. She later told The New
                York Times:
                "I just wanted to have a private life. Once, as my friend was telling me they had cancer, someone came up
                and asked, in
                the middle of the conversation, if they could take a photograph with me. You get me? That's enough, right?"
                She refused
                to do promos for her tours, began to wear a mask on stage and became increasingly dependent on drugs and
                alcohol on the
                road; she considered suicide. Sia fired Enthoven and hired Jonathan Daniel, who suggested that she write
                songs for other
                artists.</p>

            <h1>2015–2017: This Is Acting</h1>
            <p>In an interview with NME in February 2015, Sia revealed that she had completed the follow-up to 1000 Forms of
                Fear,
                entitled This Is Acting. The album was another collaboration with producer and co-writer Greg Kurstin.
                Furler said that
                she released 1000 Forms of Fear to free herself from her record deal and had planned simply to write for
                other artists,
                but the album's success spurred her to continue writing her own music. The same month, alongside the digital
                deluxe
                release of 1000 Forms of Fear, she released a mobile game, Bob Job. "Alive" from This Is Acting was
                co-written by Adele
                and had originally been intended for Adele's third album.</p>
